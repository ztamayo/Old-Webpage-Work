	<p>Assassin's Creed II is a historical action-adventure stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal 
	and published by Ubisoft for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. It is the second 
	video game installment of the Assassin's Creed series, and is a direct sequel to the 2007 video game 
	Assassin's Creed.  </p>
	
	<p>The frame story is set in the 21st century, with player-controlled protagonist Desmond Miles escaping 
	from Abstergo Industries with an employee, Lucy Stillman, after being forced to relive the genetic memories 
	of ancestral assassin Alta√Ør ibn-La'Ahad through a machine known as the "Animus". After escaping from 
	Abstergo, Desmond enters a device which is more advanced than the original Animus, the Animus 2.0, and 
	relives the genetic memories of ancestral nobleman Ezio Auditore da Firenze, who lived during the 
	Renaissance period of the late 15th and early 16th centuries in Italy. The player controls Ezio, who becomes 
	an Assassin after his father and brothers are murdered by a traitor to their family. While controlling Ezio, the 
	player can explore game renditions of Italian cities, regions, and landmarks in open world gameplay.  </p>

	<p>In Assassin's Creed II, you play as an assassin named Ezio.  At the beginning of the game, Ezio loses his
	father and brothers and this thrusts him into becoming an assassin set on avenging their deaths.  The game is
	interesting because you are actually a character named Desmond who is reliving the life of his ancestor, Ezio.
	The game is best played as stealth, but you have the option to not play that way most of the time.  In the game, 
	you are in various cities in Renaissance Italy.  Ezio does a lot of climbing and the scenery is beautiful.  
	Possibly the best aspect of AC II is the scenery.  This is a fun and asthetically pleasing game. </p>
