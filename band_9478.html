		<dl>
			<dt>If It Was You</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Released in 2002.  This is the second studio album from Tegan and Sara.  The album contains songs with fast-paced, 
					catchy beats and great lyrics.  This was the album that turned Tegan and Sara into my favoirte musical group.  Favorite
					songs include: Time Running, You Went Away, Monday Monday Monday, I Hear Noises and Living Room.
				</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>The Con</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Released in 2007.  The Con has a different sound than previous albums from the group.  The album has a darker sound to 
					it and the lyrics feel more mysterious.  This album was co-produced by Christopher Walla from Death Cab for Cutie.  For 
					the first time we hear a Tegan and Sara song that sounds electronic - Are You Ten Years Ago.  Personal favorites are
					Hop a Plane, The Con, Are You Ten Years Ago, Nineteen and Call It Off.

			<dt>Sainthood</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Released in 2009.  This is a more direct album compared to the moments of ambiguity found in The Con album.  The album is 
					more fast-paced than the previous and the songs sound more upbeat, though the lyrics still maintain their signature depth.
					Favorites include: Don't Rush, On Directing, The Cure, Northshore and The Ocean.
				</p>

			<dt>Hearthrob</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Released January 29, 2013.  Hearthrob marks the band's attempt to break into the mainstream pop culture.  The album is 
					decidedly more pop and electronic than any of their other albums, featuring danceable tunes.  However, Tegan and Sara 
					remain faithful to providing their listeners with memorable songs that contain meaningful lyrics.  Though a favorite album, it 
					lacks the signature punk song that is featured in previous albums.  Favorite songs: Closer, Goodbye Goodbye, Drove Me
					Wild, Love They Say and Now I'm All Messed Up.
