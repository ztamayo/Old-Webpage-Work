	A Cuban sandwich is a variation of a ham and cheese sandwich originally created in cafes catering to Cuban workers in Cuba 
	and in the early Cuban immigrant communities of Florida: Key West and Ybor City, Tampa. Later on, Cuban 
	exiles and expatriates brought it to Miami where it is also still very popular. The sandwich is made with ham, roasted 
	pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, and sometimes salami on Cuban bread.
	
	The traditional Cuban sandwich starts with Cuban bread. The loaf is sliced into lengths of 8-12 inches (20â€“30 cm), lightly 
	buttered or brushed with olive oil on the crust, and cut in half horizontally. A coat of yellow mustard is spread on the bread. 
	Then roast pork, glazed ham, Swiss cheese, and thinly-sliced dill pickles are added in layers. Sometimes the pork is marinated 
	in mojo and slow roasted.

	Swiss cheese is a generic name for several related varieties of North American cheese which resemble Emmental cheese, a yellow, 
	medium-hard cheese that originated in the area around Emmental, in Switzerland. Some types of Swiss cheese have a distinctive 
	appearance, as the blocks of the cheese are riddled with holes known as "eyes". Swiss cheese without eyes is known as "blind".
	
	Three types of bacteria are used in the production of Emmental cheese: Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus, 
	Lactobacillus (Lactobacillus helveticus or Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies bulgaricus), and Propionibacterium 
	(Propionibacterium freudenreichii subspecies shermani). In a late stage of cheese production, the propionibacteria consume the 
	lactic acid excreted by the other bacteria and release acetate, propionic acid, and carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide slowly forms 
	the bubbles that develop the "eyes". The acetate and propionic acid give Swiss its nutty and sweet flavor. Historically, the holes 
	were seen as a sign of imperfection and cheese makers originally tried to avoid them by pressing during production. In modern times, 
	the holes have become an identifier of the cheese.

	In general, the larger the eyes in a Swiss cheese, the more pronounced its flavor because a longer fermentation period gives the bacteria 
	more time to act. This poses a problem, however, because cheese with large eyes does not slice well and comes apart in mechanical 
	slicers. As a result, industry regulators have limited the eye size by which Swiss cheese receives the Grade A stamp.
