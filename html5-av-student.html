			<h3>Example of the audio element</h3>
		</header>
		<p>
		<p>In this section of the assignment, you'll be working with the audio element. To fill in the blanks for this section of the assignment, do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Write the code to embed the audio</li>
				<li>Include a "fallback" link to the audio, in case html5 isn't supported in the browser that you are testing in.</li>
				<li>Use the "type" attribute</li>
				<li>Try out at least two of the attributes below (select any/all that interest you) 
					<ol>
						<li>autoplay</li>
						<li>controls</li>
						<li>preload</li>
						<li>loop</li>
						<li>title</li>
					</ol>
						</li>
				<li>Test the page in four browsers -- without uploading to the FC server -- and use complete sentences to explain what you found in each. For example, "I tested in IE8 on a PC running Windows 7. Audio would play, but sound couldn't be heard. Controls display with a red box, etc. <strong>Include the version of the browser (ex: IE9, Firefox 5) and platform (mac or pc).</strong> Here are the browsers in which you must test. If you subsititute (ex., Opera for Safari), say so and report the findings. (I expect that the findings in each browser will be different.)
					<ol>
						<li>Internet Explorer</li>
						<li>Firefox</li>
						<li>Safari</li>
						<li>Chrome</li>
					</ol>

			<h3>Example of the video element</h3>
		</header>
		<p>
		<p>In this section of the assignment, you'll be working with the video element. To fill in the blanks for this section of the assignment, do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Write the code to embed the video</li>
				<li>Include a "fallback" link to the video, in case html5 isn't supported in the browser that you are testing in.</li>
				<li>Use the "type" attribute</li>
				<li>Try out at least two additional attributes below (select any/all that interest you) 
					<ol>
						<li>controls</li>
						<li>poster (along with image)</li>
						<li>preload</li>
						<li>width</li>
						<li>height</li>
					</ol>
						</li>
				<li>Test the page in four browsers -- without uploading to the FC web server -- and use complete sentences to explain what you found in each, i.e., Tested in IE8 on a PC running Windows 7. Video wouldn't display, was redirected to a YouTube page, had to click the video to download, wouldn't play, worked fine, etc. Include the version of the browser (ex: IE9, Firefox 5) and platform (mac or pc). Here are the browsers in which you must test. If you subsititute (ex., Opera for Safari), say so and report the findings.
					<ol>
						<li>Internet Explorer</li>
						<li>Firefox</li>
						<li>Safari</li>
						<li>Chrome</li>
					</ol>
						</li>
				<li class="important">For extra credit, experiment with "iframe" by locating a free video that is fairly short in length and small in filesize. Remember, you only have 50mb of web space allotted to you. If you exceed that, you won't be able to upload anything. Include this video below the example above. In order to receive extra credit, follow the same procedures.</li>
